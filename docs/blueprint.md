# **App Name**: NextGen Node Starter

## Core Features:

- Basic Page Routing: Implement a Next.js page structure to handle basic routing and navigation.
- API Route Handling: Set up Node.js API routes to handle server-side logic and data fetching.
- Component Library Integration: Integrate a component library for a set of pre-built React components to accelerate development. Implement button and navigation bar components to begin.
- Environment Configuration: Use environment variables for storing configuration settings to differentiate local development and deployment configurations.
- Simple Data Display: Create components to display fetched data. This will validate data fetching from Node and displaying on React components works well
- Dependency Management: Leverage 'npm' to include useful libraries such as Axios to manage requests and responses.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Slate Blue (#708090) to convey a sense of stability and modernism.
- Background color: Light Gray (#D3D3D3) to provide a clean and neutral canvas, keeping the focus on the content.
- Accent color: Dark Cyan (#008B8B) to offer contrast and highlight key interactive elements such as buttons.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif font for a clean, modern user experience.
- Use minimalist, line-based icons for navigation and interactive elements to convey a sense of simplicity.
- Maintain a clean and organized layout with consistent spacing and alignment. Implement a grid system for responsive design.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and hover effects on interactive elements such as buttons to give feedback.
